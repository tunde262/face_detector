# Real-Time Face Detection using Computer Vision

This project demonstrates real-time face detection using Python and OpenCV. It utilizes a pre-trained Haar cascade classifier to detect faces from live webcam footage and overlays rectangles around detected faces.

## Features
- Real-time face detection using a webcam feed.
- Drawing rectangles around faces as they are detected.
- Designed to be easy to run and modify for other applications of computer vision.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`opencv-python` package)
- NumPy (`numpy` package)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-time-face-detection.git
   cd real-time-face-detection
